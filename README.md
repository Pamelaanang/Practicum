notusefulbutraw_data is the original file that contains everything in the sentence format.

Database is the file we used inside of the python where the first row and column disappear to avoid the duplication.

Tuple matrix1 is the csv file that only shows the two words relationship (x,y).

The interactive matrix html is what I created for the backlog task 4,5,8. 

The basematrix_list.ipynb is the code I used in Python that I transferred the data into list and cleaned the extra "", and also filled the blanks with NA.
